# AIRobotCar
Robot car with artificial intelligence

Hi, this is my first Arduino project. I want to develop a robot car that has artificial intelligence built in, to avoid obstacles. Also I will add in the future Wi-Fi module to comunicate with a raspberryPi, and ability to be controlled remotely from any computer in the world (via web server, running by raspberryPi).

Materials used:
  - Arduino Mega
  - Arduino Motor Shield
  - 3 Ultra Sonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
  - Car Chassi
